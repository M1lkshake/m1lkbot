M1lkbot is a discord user-bot, meaning that it runs off of YOUR account.

In order to use this bot, you need to accept the following semi-official Discord rules on selfbots.


- A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, respond to other user's messages. This means it should not respond to commands, should not autoreply to certain keywords, etc. You must be the only one that can control it.

- A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, do "invite scraping". This is the action of detecting server invites in chat, and automatically joining a server using that invite.

- As selfbots run under your account they are subject to the same Terms of Service. Meaning they should not spam, insult or demean others, post NSFW material, spread viruses or illegal material, etc. They have to follow the same rules that you follow.

If you consent and accept to these rules, you may proceed with using my self-bot.

To setup this bot, you need to run setup.bat. All this program does is download the required libraries ((You NEED node.js for this.)) to make sure that this program will work. After that, you will need to run the newly created file run.bat, and it should load up the bot perfectly fine.

If you are a console kind of person, you can navigate to the install folder and execute "node self.js".
